The Goal of this assignment was to create a weather dashboard that had the current conditions of temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index, as well as a 5 day forecast for the selected city.
We were to also save the searched city to a list to be able to recall as requested, and be able to empty the list if necessary.
The application has been deployed to a Github Page at:https://risingphoenix86.github.io/Homework6-WeatherDash/
